Engine Simulation Program. Written by Reynolds and Lumley.

# What's new
I forked this project from Stanford HPC Center's github account to facilitate compiling this program on newer platforms instead of having to rely on emulators or compatibility layers. The ZIP file uploaded there was simply a copy of the floppy drive that the code had been stored on, and did not lend itself to building easily. I added a makefile to further simplify the process.

This has been confirmed to build under OS X with gfortran. I'd imagine Linux and Windows with Cygwin would also compile successfully. I have no experience with a native Windows build system, so this may or may not build in those conditions. If you have experience, please feel free to submit a pull request with your changes.

## Notes

I am not an Engine/Chemistry expert - I mostly undertook this project out of interest to resurrect the program for educational purposes - both for me to see if I could do it, and to see that this program gets new life as an educational tool. The program appears to run as intended - but as always ensure that your results make sense.
